#' Linkage disequilibrium decay distance.
#' 
#' Estimates the linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay distance by fitting a 
#' monotonically decreasing spline to estimates of pairwise LD.
#' 
#' @param ld A data frame with two columns: \code{Bin} contains the distance 
#'   between SNP pairs (or bin widths) and \code{R2} contains the estimated LD.
#' @param threshold The strength at which LD is considered decayed (default: 0.3).
#' @param k The number of knots to use for spline fitting (default: 30)
#' 
#' @details This function estimates the LD decay distance by fitting a monotonically 
#'   decreasing spline to empirical estimates of LD. The units of \code{Bin} may 
#'   vary, depending on application. For example, local LD decay around an 
#'   individual SNP can be calculated where each row of \code{ld} is the measure 
#'   of LD between that SNP and a second SNP with the base-pair distance between 
#'   them. Alternatively, global LD decay could be calculated where LD measures 
#'   are aggregated into bins of 20,000 bp, for example.
#' 
#' @return The distance in units of the \code{Bin} column at which LD is estimated 
#'   to reach \code{threshold}.
